👋 Hello World! I'm Nagam Sreehitha Reddy

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! I'm currently a 2nd-year undergraduate student passionate about technology, especially in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Full Stack Development**.

🚀 About Me

- 🎓 B.Tech Student (2nd Year)
- 🔍 Currently exploring the world of **AI/ML**, starting with Python and scikit-learn
- 💻 Building strong foundations in **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Problem Solving**
- 🌱 Learning new tools and frameworks step by step (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React)

🎯 Goals with This Repository

This repo serves as a **starting point** and a personal **learning journal** where I plan to:
- Document my journey into **AI/ML**
- Share small but meaningful projects and practice notebooks
- Track what I learn week-by-week
- Reflect on challenges, mistakes, and improvements

You’ll likely find:
- 📁 Python notebooks exploring ML basics
- 📚 Notes from online courses and tutorials
- 💡 Mini projects that grow as I learn
- 📊 Experimentation with datasets

🧠 Topics I’m Currently Learning

- ✅ Python fundamentals
- ✅ scikit-learn and basic ML models (Linear Regression, KNN, etc.)
- 🔄 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- 📊 Pandas & Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
- 🧠 Concepts like Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

💼 Long-Term Roadmap

- 🔜 Build end-to-end ML projects using real datasets
- 🔜 Start contributing to open-source AI tools and libraries
- 🔜 Learn advanced models (Neural Networks, NLP)
- 🔜 Participate in hackathons and ML competitions
